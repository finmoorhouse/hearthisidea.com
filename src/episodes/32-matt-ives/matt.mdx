P.S. For this and most future episodes, we've chosen to write a briefer write-up than normal. Writing our more involved write-ups often takes longer than producing the episodes themselves, so we're dialling down this effort to focus on producing more episodes. We get the impression this is what our audience would prefer, but let us know if you'll miss the long write-ups!
