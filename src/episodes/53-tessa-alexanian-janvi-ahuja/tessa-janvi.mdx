[Tessa Alexanian](https://tessa.fyi/) is the [Safety & Security Program](https://responsibility.igem.org/) Officer at the [iGEM Foundation](https://igem.org/). Tessa is a fellow at the [Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity Initiative](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/emergingbioleaders/), was previously a fellow at the [Foresight Institute](https://foresight.org/), and co-founded the [East Bay Biosecurity Group](https://www.eastbaybiosecurity.org/). You can read more about what she's up to on her (excellent!) [website](https://tessa.fyi/).

[Janvi Ahuja](https://www.janvi.xyz/) is a PhD student in computational biology at the University of Oxford, where she is affiliated with the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) and works with MIT's [Nucleic Acid Observatory](https://www.naobservatory.org/). Janvi is also a fellow at the [Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity Initiative](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/emergingbioleaders/), and was previously an intern at the UN's [Biological Weapons Convention ISU](https://www.un.org/disarmament/biological-weapons/implementation-support-unit/). Listeners may remember Janvi from co-hosting our [episode](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/karpur) with Ajay Karpur.


We discuss:

* How synthetic biology began and why it is an exploding field
* The iGEM competition and how to get involved in the community
* Challenges and trade-offs in creating a culture of responsibility in synthetic biology
* Emerging risks in synthetic biology and what this means for global catastrophic risks
* Technical projects in biosecurity and career advice for how to get involved
