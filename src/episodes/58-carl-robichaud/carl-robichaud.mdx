### Corrections

A couple minor inaccuracies are par for the course on a nearly four hour podcast! Carl notes the following corrections, none of which change the substance of the interview:

- When naming nuclear states, Carl mentioned *England* rather than the *United Kingdom*
- When mentioning states which explored a nuclear weapons program, Carl mentioned Spain. While there is some anecdotal evidence that Spain considered nuclear weapons, they are not included in official datasets
- The editor at the New Yorker at the time of the publication of John Hersey's *Hiroshima* was called [Harold Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Ross), not John Ross
