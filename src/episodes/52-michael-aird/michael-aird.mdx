In this episode, we talked to [Michael Aird](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/michaela).

Michael is a senior research manager at [Rethink Priorities](https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/), where he co-leads the Artificial Intelligence Governance and Strategy team alongside Amanda El-Dakhakhni. Before that he conducted nuclear risk research for Rethink Priorities and longtermist macrostrategy research for Convergence Analysis, the Center on Long-Term Risk, and the Future of Humanity Institute, which is where we know each other from. And before that he was a teacher and a stand up comedian.

Jonas Sandbrink is a researcher and DPhil student at the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/). He is a fellow at both the [Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity Initiative](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/emergingbioleaders/) at the Johns Hopkins [Center for Health Security](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/), and with the [Ending Bioweapons Program](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/fellowship-for-ending-bioweapons-programs/) at the [Council on Strategic Risks](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/). Jonas’ research interests include the dual-use potential of life sciences research and biotechnology, as well as fast response countermeasures like vaccine platforms.
