Nikhil Krishnan is a lecturer at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Cambridge, and Fellow in Philosophy at Robinson College. He also [writes](https://www.notion.so/Nikhil-Krishnan-845050fce07d4d13962724401583d92e) on on history, literature, and culture. His first book, provisionally titled *A Terribly Serious Adventure*, tells the story of philosophy in Oxford from 1900 to 1960.

In this episode, we discussed two broad topics. In the first half, Nikhil relates some of this history of 20th century Oxford philosophy â€” and, by extension, the history of 'analytic' or 'linguistic' philosophy. In the latter half, we consider some questions about the present and future for academic philosophy, the role of universities, and the place of the peer-reviewed journal.

In the article below, we summarise and illustrate the key points from the episode; providing more detail and further reading for listeners who want to find out more.
