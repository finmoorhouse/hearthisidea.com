[Sebastian Joy](https://www.sebastianjoy.com/) is founding President of ProVeg International, a food awareness organisation working to transform the global food system. He is also a social entrepreneur: having developed several vegan products and helped launch the international "[50by40](https://50by40.org/)" alliance.

In this episode, we talk about Sebastian's career and the work that ProVeg does. We begin by asking Sebastian how he came to join the animal advocacy movement, reflecting on his early experiences with [PETA](https://www.peta.org/) and the German Vegetarian Society. This brings us to Sebastian's reasons for launching ProVeg. We then talk about the work ProVeg does â€” especially corporate engagement and how the meat industry operates. Finally, we discuss Sebastian's experiences as a "serial social entrepreneur", and he offers advice about launching and scaling up nonprofit startup ideas.

In the article below, we summarise and illustrate the key points from the episode; providing more detail and further reading for listeners who want to find out more.
