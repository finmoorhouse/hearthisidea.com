In this episode, we discuss Guive's paper, ['Will Humanity Choose Its Future?'](https://philarchive.org/rec/ASSWHC).
* What is an 'evolutionary future', and would it count as an existential catastrophe?
* How did the agricultural revolution deliver a world which few people would have chosen?
* What does it mean to say that we are living in the ['dreamtime'](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/this-is-the-dream-timehtml)? Will it last?
* What competitive pressures in the future could drive the world to undesired outcomes?
  * Digital minds
  * Space settlement
* What measures could prevent an evolutionary future, and allow humanity to more deliberately choose its future?
  * World government
  * Strong global coordination
  * Defensive advantage
* Should this all make us more or less hopeful about humanity's future?
* Ideas for further research
