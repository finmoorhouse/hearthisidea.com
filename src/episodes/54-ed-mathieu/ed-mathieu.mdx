We discuss:

* What Ed learned from working with governments and the WHO in reporting Covid data
* A simple change the WHO could make to radically improve how countries share data for the next pandemic
* The idea of 'experimental longtermism'
* How Ed is thinking about collecting data on [transformative artificial intelligence](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/) and other potential existential risks
* Figuring out the value of making everyone slightly better-informed
* Lessons for starting a career in impact-oriented data science
* And finally... Ed's favourite OWID chart
