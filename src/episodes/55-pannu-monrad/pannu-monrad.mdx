[Jassi Pannu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jassipannu/) is a Resident Physician at Stanford, a Visiting Scholar at [John Hopkins](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/), and a Fellow at the [Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity Initiative](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/emergingbioleaders/).

[Joshua Monrad](https://twitter.com/jtmonrad) is a Biosecurity Program Officer at [Effective Giving](https://www.effectivegiving.org/) and a Researcher at Oxford's [Future Humanity Institute](https://fhi.ox.ac.uk/).

We discuss:

* The post-COVID biosecurity landscape, including the American Pandemic Preparedness Plan
* The Biological Weapons Convention and current issues in dual-use research
* The role of antivirals, increasing vaccine capacity, and market failures
* Similarities and differences between GCBR mitigation and general pandemic preparedness
* How some interventions are underpinned by global cooperation
