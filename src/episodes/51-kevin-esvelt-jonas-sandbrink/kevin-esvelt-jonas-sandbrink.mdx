In this episode, Fin talks to [Kevin Esvelt](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/esvelt/overview/) and [Jonas Sandbrink](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/team/jonas-sandbrink/).

Kevin Esvelt is an assistant professor at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), where he is director of the [Sculpting Evolution group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/sculpting-evolution/overview/), which invents new ways to study and influence the evolution of ecosystems. He helped found the [SecureDNA Project](https://www.securedna.org/) and the [Nucleic Acid Observatory](https://www.naobservatory.org/), both of which we discuss in the episode. Esvelt is also known for proposing the idea of using [CRISPR to implement gene drives](https://www.synthego.com/blog/gene-drive-crispr).

Jonas Sandbrink is a researcher and DPhil student at the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/). He is a fellow at both the [Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity Initiative](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/emergingbioleaders/) at the Johns Hopkins [Center for Health Security](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/), and with the [Ending Bioweapons Program](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/fellowship-for-ending-bioweapons-programs/) at the [Council on Strategic Risks](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/). Jonas’ research interests include the dual-use potential of life sciences research and biotechnology, as well as fast response countermeasures like vaccine platforms.

We discuss:

- The concepts of differential technological development, dual-use research, transfer risks in research, ['information loops'](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c9KFL8sBxxyPqLai4/new-ideas-for-mitigating-biotechnology-misuse#4__Information_loops_to_steer_funding_to_less_risky_projects), and responsible access to biological data
- Strengthening norms against risky biological research, such as [novel virus identification](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/5/7/22973296/virus-hunting-discovery-deep-vzn-global-virome-project) and gain of function research
- Connection-based warning systems and [metagenomic sequencing](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/karpur) technology
- Advanced PPE, Far-UVC sterilisation technology, and other [countermeasures against pandemics](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/u5JesqQ3jdLENXBtB/concrete-biosecurity-projects-some-of-which-could-be-big-1#Medical_countermeasures) potentially worse than Covid
- Analogies between progress in biotechnology and the early history of nuclear weapons
- How to use your career to work on these problems — even if you don’t have a background in biology.
