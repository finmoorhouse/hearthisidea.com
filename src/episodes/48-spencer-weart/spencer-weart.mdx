Dr [Spencer R. Weart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_R._Weart) served as the Director of the [Center for History of Physics](https://www.aip.org/history-programs/physics-history) at the [American Institute of Physics](https://www.aip.org/) from 1974 to 2009. He is the author of several books, including [The Discovery of Global Warming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78687.The_Discovery_of_Global_Warming) and [The Rise of Nuclear Fear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13601839-the-rise-of-nuclear-fear). In our conversation, we discuss:

* How climate science emerged, what it took for scientists to form a consensus in the mid-1960s, and how that consensus has evolved since
* The IPCC’s emerging understanding of so-called “tipping points” in the climate system, and our current best guesses as to what kind of threat they pose
* Exploring the changing cultural relationship humans have had with nuclear energy — and why it remains stigmatised amongst many environmental groups

## Resources on Climate Change

Throughout our interview we discuss Spencer's website [Discovery of Global Warming]( https://history.aip.org/climate/index.htm#contents) – "a hypertext history of how scientists came to (partly) understand the problem of climate change".  Below are some notes I took in preparation for the interview. You can find much more detail on the website itself. If you want to dig in deeper into the science, I also recommend [Skeptical Science](https://skepticalscience.com/) as an online resource, which rebuttals climate misinformation and debunked theories.

### Early Science

* Most research begins with flawed theories, which will drive people to propose better ones. Many papers, perhaps most of them, harbour misconceptions or plain errors. After all research by definition operates past the edge of the known. 
* The theoretical possibility of climate change was posited back in the 1800s. In the 1820s [Joseph Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier "Joseph Fourier") proposed the [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect "Greenhouse effect") to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the sun's energy alone could explain. In 1856 [Eunice Newton Foote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunice_Newton_Foote "Eunice Newton Foote") demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than dry air, and even more for CO2.  Three years later, [John Tyndall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall) found similar results, and his are now commonly regarded as `foundational to climate science'.
* People believed that many stabilisation mechanisms were in place, in particular that the oceans would just absorb excess CO2. However, [Roger Revelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Revelle) realised in 1957 that because of sea water chemical makeup it would.be re-emited soon after [see Spencer's [essay](https://history.aip.org/climate/Revelle.htm)]
  * A secondary proposed stabilisation mechanism was the vegetation effect, whereby more atmospheric CO2 would stimulate plant growth, which turn helps absorb excess CO2. However, as we know now, at some point CO2 no longer becomes the constraining growth, and excess CO2 might actually lead to soil erosion or dark leaves absorbing more radiation
* Early climate forecasts didn't take into account exponential economic growth, instead assuming linear growth. Hence forecasts like Plass (1956) predicted that human activity would raise global average temperatures by 1.1 degree Celsius per century

### Early Observations

* It was hard to know if CO2 was rising because imprecise measurements, especially because the levels of atmospheric CO2 where still very low. So it was very hard to make out trends from noise.
* Moreover, the rise in dust pollution worked in the opposite direction from the rise in CO2 so nobody could say whether there would be cooling or warming. Some scientists extrapolated out the [Milkanovitch cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) (variations in Earth's orbit and tilt, affecting the planets worried) and became worried that earth was experiencing global cooling as it was heading to an ice age
  * In fact, some early climate models calculated a temperature rise twice that historically observed. Scientists did get the CO2 increase right but didn't incorporate the partially offsetting `human volcano' from polluting aerosols
* "*The temporary cooling from the 1940s to the 1960s (in the northern hemisphere) had been bad luck for climate science. By feeding skepticism about the greenhouse effect and by provoking some scientists and many journalists to speculate publicly about the coming of a new ice age, the new cool spell gave the field a reputation for fecklessness that it would not soon live down*"
* It was only in 1960 that the [Keeling Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_Curve) became the first "proof" of Earth's increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. [see Spencer's [essay](http://history.aip.org/climate/Kfunds.htm)]

### Many interwoven threads

* **Computing**: In the 1950s, scientists began to try and model the climate with computers. However, predictions from such  early models appeared very fragile — even a difference in fifth decimal point on the grid (i.e. a truncated error) would change predictions completely past 20 days. When it came to climate, "there was no long run average to speak of". This intersected with chaos theory, whereby a butterfly wing. By the mid 1970s, many experts found it plausible that at some indeterminate point a small push could trigger severe climate change. [see Spencer's [essay](http://history.aip.org/climate/simple.htm)]

* **Ice Ages**: Early studies of climate change were focused around trying to explain large movements in glaciers. New ice drilling evidence showed that — unlike longhand consensus — there weren't four ice ages that unravelled under tens of thousands of years, but many `mini' ice ages that took sometimes only took hundreds. Paraphrasing Spencer's book, "in the 60s scientists believed ice ages must take tens of thousands of years, in the 70s thousands of years and in the 80s hundreds of years, could actually happen in a few decades." [see Spencer's [essay](http://history.aip.org/climate/cycles.htm)]

* **Ozone Layer**: Experts thought that CFCs were environmentally sound. They were produced in relative small quantities. And they were extremely stable, never reacting with animals and plants. It turned out that the stability itself made CFCs a hazard. They would linger in the air for for centuries and eventually some would drift up into the atmosphere. There UV rays activated them and they became catalysts in a process that destroyed the ozone. This didn't have anything to do with climate change per se. But it demonstrated damage of human pollution, fragility of atmosphere, and that the resulting Montrealt Protocol showed the international community could rally around a scientific message.

### Forming a Consensus

* Early climate science was funded by the US military as part of its fundamental research. Part of this was motivated by early hopes of weaponising the weather. Scientists working on climate change were often doing so as a "side gig".
* But warnings from scientists did reach high-level decision surprisingly pretty quickly!
  * In 1965, the Presidents Scientific Advisory Committee formed a panel on environmental issues including a sub-panel of climate experts who put greenhouse effect on official agenda at highest level of government
  * In 1966, the National Academy of Scientists published report on climate change, observing that it was a real and possibly drastic threat. However, to quote Spencer, **"The primary conclusions was typical of such reports — a maxim that came from the heart of scientists belief in their calling — More Money Should Be Spent on Research"*
* In 1979, The National Research Council released published the “[Charney Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jule_Gregory_Charney#Charney_Report)” – a set estimate of the climate sensitivity, that is  how much Earth would warm if it's CO2 concentration doubled. It split the difference between Hansen's General Circulation Model (~4C) and Manabe's latest figures (~2C), giving a 3C best guess with a 1.5-4.5C range.
  * This result has remained surprisingly consistent for over 40 years now. The IPCC didn't revise it until 2007, and it is now very close at 2.5-4C. However, note that climate sensitivity does not speak as too how much CO2e humans will actually pollute
  * For more details on today's "multiple methods" to calculate climate sensitivity (including models, instruments, paleo evidence, and combined approaches), see this [explainer piece](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-scientists-estimate-climate-sensitivity/).

### Science and Politics

* Initial environmental fears weren't focused around global warming at all. Instead they were mostly about nuclear testing changing weather and chemicals. To quote Spencer,
  * "*The charged language of defilement and transgression rarely appeared outside the nuclear and chemical controversies. But for climate too many felt that natural processes somehow followed not only scientific law but also moral law. Since prehistoric times tribal people had attributed climate troubles such as an unusually bad winter to the violation of a taboo and in modern times it bit unknown for preachers to get forgiveness in their prayers for rain. Once people began to grasp that human tech actually could alter the planetary system for better or worse journalists found it easier to suggest that burning fossil fuses could change the climate*"

* However, climate change became a much more political topic in 80s, where it became associated with the green movement and set against the deregulation pro-growth politics of the times. Throughout the decade, US public awareness of the Greenhouse Gas effect rose from 38% to 79%.
  * Though it is also worth noting that Margaret Thatcher was the first major world leader to call out climate changed. As Spencer notes, it may have helped she was a chemist (see this [article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-science-advice-climate-change), for example)

* Scientists themselves also called for more political action in the 1980s. In 1988, the [Toronto Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Conference_on_the_Changing_Atmosphere) saw scientists across the world discuss the need for an international response to climate change. In the same year, the [International Panel on Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change) was created as a unique hybrid of a scientific and political body [see Spencer's [essay](http://history.aip.org/climate/internat.htm)]
* The IPCC set led to a new policy-science rhythm: IPCC reviews science twice a decade; international negations are held; nations take actions; repeat. Its first report in 1990 warned that global warming was underway but would take another decade before it could attribute it to humans. Its second report in 1995 reaffirmed the initial results, but this time attributed to humans with certainty.
* However, political action did not follow quickly. For example, the [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) (1992) showed climate change was now linked to power struggle between rich and developing — with the former not agreeing to make cuts unless. The US senate rejected it 95–0.
