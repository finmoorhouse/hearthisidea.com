Jason Crawford is the founder of [The Roots of Progress](https://rootsofprogress.org), a nonprofit dedicated to establishing a new philosophy of progress for  the 21st century. He writes and speaks about the history and philosophy of progress, especially in technology and industry. In our conversation, we discuss:

- What progress is, and why it matters (maybe more than you think)
- How to think about resource constraints — why they are sometimes both real and surmountable
- The 'low-hanging fruit' explanation for stagnation, and prospects for speeding up innovation
- Tradeoffs between progress and (existential) safety
- Differences between the [Progress Studies](https://www.progressforum.org/) and [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) communities
