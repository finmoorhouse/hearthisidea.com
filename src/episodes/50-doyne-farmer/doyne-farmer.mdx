We talk to Professor Doyne Farmer, the Baillie Gifford Professor in Mathematics at Oxford, the Director of the Complexity Economics programme at INET, and an External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute.

In this episode, we discuss:

- How Doyne and his friends used physics and hidden computers to beat the roulette wheel in Las Vegas casinos
- Advancing economic models to better predict business cycles and knock-on effects from extreme events like Covid-19
- Techniques for predicting technological progress and long-run growth, with specific applications to energy technologies and climate change
