Over the next few episodes we will be exploring the potential for catastrophe cause by advanced artificial intelligence. But before we look *ahead*, we wanted to give a primer on where we are today: on the history and trends behind the development of AI so far. In this episode, we discuss:

- How semiconductors have historically been related to US military strategy
- How the Taiwanese company [TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english) became such an important player in this space — while other countries’ attempts have failed
- What the [CHIPS Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/) signals about attitudes to compute governance in the decade ahead

In future episodes, we will explicitly talk about existential risks posed by artificial intelligence and the geopolitics of advance computing. But if you want to skip ahead, we suggest reading…
