**Note**: you can also see this job advert on this google doc.

**Job Description:** Hear This Idea is looking for a social media manager to help our episodes reach a wider audience. The producer will work with and under the close supervision of the two co-hosts (Fin Moorhouse and Luca Righetti). 

We anticipate this will involve a range of jobs, listed here roughly in order of importance:

- Taking care of uploading episodes and transcripts to our website
- Sharing those episodes to Twitter
- Sharing our episodes on other social media platforms, such as YouTube
- Drafting and posting tweets which share other news and ideas in effective altruism, beyond our podcast
- Helping organise any potential programs we run, such as a small grants program
- Producing audio waveform video snippets from episode highlights and sharing them
- Starting and promoting an email newsletter
- Cross-posting episode transcripts to Substack
- Coming up with and executing any other creative new ideas to promote the podcast!

We are open to applications from people who are interested in doing only audio editing or only e.g. graphics work, although we would have a weak preference for someone who has potential to eventually do both.
