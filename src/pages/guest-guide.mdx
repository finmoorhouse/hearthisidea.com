This page contains some general advice and sets some context for upcoming guests on Hear This Idea; but feel free to send specific questions to Fin ([fin@hearthisidea.com](mailto:fin@hearthisidea.com)) or Luca ([luca@hearthisidea.com](mailto:luca@hearthisidea.com)).

We’re excited to have the chance to speak to you!

## In brief

- Hear This Idea is a podcast about [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/). Most of our listeners are in their early careers (mid 20s) and many have a background in research or academia.
- You don’t need to do anything to prepare! We will write questions in advance to help guide the conversation, which we can share with you if that would be useful.
- Episodes are typically ~two hours long and have a conversational tone. Because they are edited, you are welcome to retake answers and take time to think. You’ll have a chance to listen back and suggest changes.
- If the episode is remote, we will record audio using [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com/). You will need a [chromium-based browser](https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/all-the-chromium-based-browsers/). If you don’t have a mic, we’d be happy to buy you one to keep.
- If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us beforehand — [hello@hearthisidea.com](mailto:hello@hearthisidea.com)!

## What is this show about?

**Hear This Idea** is a podcast about new thinking in [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/).

We produce this podcast because we really enjoy it; but also because we hope the podcast can have some positive impact — by providing useful information about important topics, and motivating people to work on them.

Our listenership skews towards people in their mid-twenties and early-careers; and towards people in research and academia (undergraduate and graduate students). Most of our audience is either familiar or involved with effective altruism: a community that aims to find the best ways to help others, and put them into practice.

You can [see all our previous episodes here](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes). Previous guests include [Peter Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer), [Eva Vivalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Vivalt), [Jeffrey Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs), [Lord John Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bird,_Baron_Bird), [Glen Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Weyl), and [Isabelle Boemeke](https://twitter.com/isabelleboemeke?lang=en).

## Before the interview

If you would like to, please send us questions and topics you’d be interested to talk about (or prefer to skip, for whatever reason). This isn’t necessary (by default we write our own questions), but we want to give you the option. We’d also be happy to send you questions in advance for you to give feedback on or prepare for.

We’ll arrange a time that suits you over email. We’re based in the UK and generally flexible within 9am–10pm GMT.

Unless you’d like to help with questions, no other prior preparation is necessary.

## What to expect in an interview

Interviews typically last around 2 hours, but we’re very flexible on this: one hour often works well (and we often go much longer than 2 hours also).

We aim for a relaxed, conversational, and collaborative vibe: much more like a seminar room conversation and less like an interview with a journalist or radio show. The show is edited; meaning **you are welcome to retake answers, leave long pauses to think, and take breaks between questions**. In fact, deliberately leaving pauses between sections and before/after questions can make our editor’s job significantly easier.

You also have full control over what gets released and what gets cut, and you’re welcome to listen through after the interview to make comments and suggestions for our editor. We want conversations to be fun rather than adversarial, so no ‘gotchas’. If you misspeak and prefer something be cut from the audio, that's no problem; just say so!

## Remote interviews

If you are doing a remote interview, we’ll use a website called [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com/). You don’t need to download anything in advance, but you do need to be using a [chromium-based browser](https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/all-the-chromium-based-browsers/) such as Chrome.

The link for our call should be **https://recording.zencastr.com/hearthisidea/your-surname**. But it should also be in your calendar invite and email correspondence. No need to show up early — you can just click the link when we’re scheduled to start.

We will show our video by default, to make it easier to chat. But we will **only record audio**, not video.

If you do not already have a high-quality (dedicated) microphone, **we’d be very happy to buy you one** (to keep). If this is the case, let us know your shipping address and we’ll order one. We do suggest testing your mic out before recording — some people forget to select the right input, etc.

You should also use headphones if possible, to avoid feedback from our voices being picked up on your mic.

## What makes for a great interview

Some thoughts we’ve collected on what seems to make for especially great interviews:

- **Being relaxed and conversational.** If this is your first time doing a podcast interview, it’s not always easy to sound perfectly natural. That’s totally fine — one easy fix is just to chat for 10–20 minutes before the recording to get into the zone. We’re happy to do this. Remember it’s a conversation, rather than a performance.
- **Being technical and detailed where necessary.** Most of our audience have some kind of academic or technical background, and they’ve signed up to listen to a fairly wonkish podcast, where we get into the weeds more than some big name podcasts. Do feel free to really take your time to explain a complicated or nuanced idea. Do also please introduce especially arcane jargon before you use it!
- **Having food and drink nearby.** Without some kind of drink, it gets a bit harder to speak clearly. Herbal tea with honey is especially good. Food also matters for energy reasons. Bananas and other energy-dense foods are great. Avoid acidic foods like apples.
- **Using notes as reminders, not scripts.** It's usually *not* a good idea to memorize what you want to say, but if you do want to spend some time preparing, it is often useful to have a few bullet points of the things you want to try to remember to say about each topic (in front of you during the taping). The best way to use notes is to glance at them to remember key points to cover, *not* to read off them directly.
- **Veering off on fun tangents.** Some of the best moments in previous episodes have come from guests 
- **Concrete examples.** Especially when explaining abstract or technical ideas, concrete examples and stories are extremely useful to help the listener keep up. We’ll prompt you for these.

## What happens after recording

After the interview, we’ll send off the recording to our editor, and we typically have a first pass ready within a couple weeks. Before we publish it, we’ll send it to you in case you’d like to listen over and suggest any changes or cuts.

We’ll also write up some accompanying notes for our website. This typically includes a headshot of you, plus places to find you online. If you have a preferred headshot, or there are any such links we’re likely to forget, let us know.

Once the episode is published, we’ll give you a few links if you want to share it.

The transcript of the episode typically goes online a few days after the episode is released.

## Giving us feedback

If at any point you are considering giving us feedback, please do. We want to establish that we are open to honest, including critical, feedback on any part of the process of being on this podcast. Feel free to give this directly to one of us or use our [anonymous feedback form here](https://tally.so/r/n0Q509).

Please let us know if you have any questions in the meantime. Also, we'd appreciate it if you didn't share this page publicly — thanks.

We’re looking forward to speaking! 

— Fin and Luca
