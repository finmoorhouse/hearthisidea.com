[Amplify creative grants](https://hearthisidea.com/grants/) is a small grants program for supporting podcasts and other creative media projects that spread ideas to help humanity navigate this century. We're happy to announce our first round of grantees!

We’re really excited by all these projects. In particular, we’re glad to have found a number of grantees looking to reach relatively neglected audiences, including through non-English language content in Spanish, French, and Hindi.

A huge thanks to [Nonlinear](https://www.nonlinear.org/) (especially [Drew Spartz](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/meta)) for helping connect us with funding, and handling much of the logistics.[^1]

[^1]: This project was originally supported through the FTX Future Fund’s regranting program. However, following the [collapse of FTX](https://80000hours.org/2022/11/regarding-the-collapse-of-ftx/) and convictions of immoral and/or illegal actions, we did not want to support the project through those means. Fortunately, we found a new donor with the help of the [Nonlinear Emergency Fund](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SkoxdYCAozBPfcJrP/announcing-nonlinear-emergency-funding). All funding the grantees received came from that donor.
